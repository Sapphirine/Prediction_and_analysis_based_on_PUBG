# Prediction_and_analysis_based_on_PUGB
In the recent years, computer gaming industry has become a more and more mainstream industry all over the world. People play games a lot and there exists some dataset of the statistics of the game people played. We chose a dataset of Playerunknown Battleground (PUBG) as the main data we are using for the project. PUBG is a currently quite popular shooting game where players can play in single, duo, and squad mode. And every game begins with a hundred players, only the last one who survived win the game, and that person is called the chicken eater. This dataset is interesting because it contains 150 features which cover a substantial amount of behaviors of a player in a single game match. And our team want to use those data to analysis the winning rate of a player in a future match and also some hidden interesting secret of the game. The technology we employ for the task is K-means for clustering and logistic regression and long-short term memory (LSTM) for prediction. And the contribution we hope to make is a general guidance for players to review the game they played and hence sharpen their skills and also for people who gamble on the game to get a higher winning rate.
